The Short North Arts District is a vibrant Columbus neighborhood known for its nightlife and dining experiences commonly enjoyed by those looking to unwind. As students, we understand that a night full of entertainment can be expensive, making it a daunting task. We sought to discover the least expensive way to explore Short North nightlife by collecting pricing data from drink menus and the bar's corresponding yelp rating. This minimization problem ensures different types of drinks are purchased, the average yelp rating of all 10 bars is at least 3.5, and that multiple bars are visited. These constraints preserve the concept of exploration and offer a variety of establishments and drink types so one can get the most out of a single night.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4c50c3c0","metadata":{"id":"4c50c3c0"},"source":["## Model Formulation\n","\n","### Decision Variables\n","\n","$y_i$, a binary variable that is 0 when

When creating our model, we were interested in creating a balanced night that includes a variety of both drink types and bars visited. We decided to run our model under a few different sets of conditions, such as increasing the average Yelp rating to 4.1, removing the average Yelp rating constraint, and removing constraints requiring multiple drink types to be purchased. We have demonstrate below that the value for the objective function does not change by a large degree when the constraints are manipulated. However, it is the case that the distribution of drink types varies widely depending on what drinks are constrained. It was also apparent that when allowing the user to purchase many drinks at a single bar, the distribution of drink types lowers significantly and only 2 bars would be preferred when minimizing. Ultimately, our model is highly sensitive to the amount of bars required and how many drinks may be purchased at each bar.
